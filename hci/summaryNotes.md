Assignment #2 : Assignment based on GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods and Selection rules)
modeling technique

- The assignment is about learning the GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods and Selection rules) modeling technique, which is a method derived from human-computer interaction (HCI) to describe human performance[1][2].
- The assignment requires knowledge of HCI and GOMS, and asks the students to implement GOMS to model user's behavior in a given scenario of unit conversions using different interface designs[3].
- The assignment explains the uses, steps, expertise, advantages, and disadvantages of GOMS, and provides the definitions of goals, operators, methods, and selection rules[1].
- The assignment also provides an example of GOMS analysis for four different interface designs: a dialog box, a GUI, a message box, and a bifurcated output. The assignment compares the execution time and the number of keystrokes for each design, and identifies the ideal design as the one with the minimum user time and information efficiency.
- The assignment also introduces five different GOMS models: the Keystroke-Level Model, CMN-GOMS, NGOMSL, CPM-GOMS, and SGOMS[4]. Each model has a different complexity and varies in activities[5]. The assignment provides some details and examples of each model.
- Keystroke-Level Model (KLM): A simple tool that predicts how long it will take an experienced user to complete a routine task in their software[2]. It uses six elements: keystroke, pointing, homing, drawing, mental preparation, and system response time.
- CMN-GOMS: A cognitive model that describes the sequential operators for a given goal. It uses goals, operators, methods, and selection rules to represent the user's actions and decisions[3][4].
- NGOMSL: A natural language with restricted English syntax that formalizes the GOMS model[5]. It allows the estimation of the learning time and the execution time for each method.
- CPM-GOMS: A model that handles parallel operations of the perceptual, cognitive, and motor processors[6]. It can account for the overlapping and interleaving of activities, such as pointing and shifting.
- SGOMS: A model that extends the GOMS model to the sociotechnical level. It considers the interaction between micro cognition and macro cognition, and the influence of the social and organizational context on the user's performance.

Assignment #3 : Assignment based on knowledge of Web Design guidelines and general UI 
design principles
- The assignment is about critiquing two interfaces of any two educational institutes and making suggestions for improvement based on web design and UI design principles[1].
- The assignment requires conducting a small user study and observing how users interact with the interfaces. The assignment also requires knowledge of web design and UI design principles, such as website purpose, simplicity, navigation, F-shaped pattern reading, visual hierarchy, content, grid-based layout, load time, mobile friendly, ease of use, user control, layout efficiency, consistency, and real-world metaphors.
- The assignment explains the importance of web design and UI design principles, and provides some examples of good and bad web design and UI design practices[2]. The assignment also provides some tips and tools for conducting user studies, such as defining the goals and objectives, choosing the methods and techniques, recruiting the participants, preparing the tasks and scenarios, collecting and analyzing the data, and reporting the findings and recommendations.
- The assignment aims to help students learn how to create effective and engaging websites that meet the needs and expectations of the users. The assignment also helps students develop their skills in user research, usability testing, and design critique.

Assignment #4 : Assignment based on knowledge of Document Object Model with JavaScript 
and CSS.

- The assignment is about implementing a simple interactive webpage, showing a tabbed UI using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and DOM (Document Object Model)[1][2].
- The assignment requires knowledge of DOM, which is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents that defines the logical structure of documents and the way they are accessed and manipulated[3].
- The assignment asks the students to create a webpage with a centered container and three tabs, each for showing a text, an image, and a YouTube video[4]. The tabs are controlled by three buttons that highlight the current tab and display the corresponding content. Only one tab should be displayed at a time[5][6].
- The assignment provides the features, structure, methods, and properties of DOM, and explains how to use JavaScript to interact with and control the DOM elements. The assignment also provides the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the webpage, and shows the output of the webpage.
- The assignment aims to help students learn how to create a simple interactive webpage using DOM with JavaScript and CSS, and how to use the document object to access and modify the HTML and CSS elements. The assignment also helps students develop their skills in web development and programming.

Assignment #5 :  Assignment based on knowledge of user interfaces using Javascript, CSS and 
HTML

- The assignment is about developing interactive user interfaces using JavaScript, CSS and HTML, specifically:[1][3]
    - implementing form-based data entry, input groups, and button elements using the Bootstrap library[5][6].
    - using responsive web design (RWD) principles[7].
    - implementing JavaScript communication between the input forms and a custom visualization component[8].
- The assignment requires knowledge of JavaScript, CSS and HTML, which are the core technologies for creating web pages and web applications[2][9].
